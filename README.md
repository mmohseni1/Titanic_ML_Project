# Titanic_ML_Project

This Machine Learning (ML) project is to predict what sort of passengers were likely to survive in the Titanic disaster occurred during the maiden voyage on April 15, 1912. 
There were 1502 killed out of 2224 passengers and crew.
The task is to use ML techniques to predict what sorts of people were likely to survive the tragedy.

For this prediction, we will use SVM classification and also Random Forest classification using scikit-learn library.

The main goal of this project is to understand and learn how to tackle ML project.
